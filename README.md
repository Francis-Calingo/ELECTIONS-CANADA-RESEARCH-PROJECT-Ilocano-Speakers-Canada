For more details on that undertaking, [please click here for that repo.](https://github.com/Francis-Calingo/ELECTIONS-CANADA-RESEARCH-PROJECT-Filipino-Canadian-Demographic-Report/)

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Per-Capita Analysis** 
- **Categorical Data Analysis (Tagalog vs. Ilocano)** 
- **Time-Series Growth Analysis** 
- **Linear Regression Modelling (Ilocano vs. Other Language Communities)** 

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here [link].

Targed SQL queries regarding various business questions can be found here [link].

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [link].

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

An interesting finding was that Ilocanos were more concentrated in Montreal (specifically the Mount Royal riding) than they are in Winnipeg.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Because data was not completely available for the newest electoral boundaries (i.e., 2023 represenation order), the last iteration of the boundaries (i.e., 2013 representation order) had to be used for calculations such as per-capita calculations.
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
