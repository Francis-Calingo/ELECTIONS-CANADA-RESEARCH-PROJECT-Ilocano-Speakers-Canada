# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Because data was not completely available for the newest electoral boundaries (i.e., 2023 represenation order), the last iteration of the boundaries (i.e., 2013 representation order) had to be used for calculations such as per-capita calculations.
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
